The seasons come and go like thoughts of you
Like a wave returns to the sea into the blue
They change but in a cycle that I can't lose
Each painful but delightful to live through
You came into my life
Just like another season
Not for long, just a time
Just like another season
Maybe this time next year
You'll reappear for no reason
But I'll cherish everyday
Until you come my way this season
The seasons turn and change just like your mind
Like the sun gives into the moon into the night
Time continues marching, it slowly crawls
With each new one starting I recall
You came into my life
Just like another season
Not for long, just a time
Just like another season
Maybe this time next year
You'll reappear for no reason
But I'll cherish every day
Until you come my way this season
Oh, this season
Oh, this season
Each time of year carries memories
Like an ever fading whisper in the breeze
Oh, we will keep on changing
All over again
Yeah we will keep on changing
Just like another season
Don't want another day without you by my side
Oh, this season
You came into my life
Just like another season
Not for long, just a time
Just like another season
Just like another season
Just like another season
