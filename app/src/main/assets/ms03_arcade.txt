A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please carry me, carry me, carry me home
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game
Oh
Oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Do you love me, love me not?
Giving pieces from my heart
Tomorrow's coming and has gone
Still I carried, I carried, I carried on
Oh
Oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh
Oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this rollercoaster
Oh
Oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh
Oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
